# ClipDiffuser-Text-to-Image-Generation
This project implements a text-to-image generation system using Latent Diffusion Models, specifically focusing on fine-tuning the CLIP text encoder while keeping other components frozen. The implementation uses the Stable Diffusion v1.5 architecture and is optimized to work on CPU environments.
